My favourite place:
There are a lot of places I like. I will just mention the recent places I have visited back in India.
1- Devkund 
2- Kundalika valley

Devkund is a waterfall destination located ~70kms from Pune, Maharashtra. You need to walk till 7kms and then need to do a trek of ~45 minutes to reach there. It's a very beautiful and dangerous place at the same time. Not feasible to go during rainy season. 

Kundalika valley is also located ~60Kms from Pune. One can directly drive to the destination spot. No trek or walk is required. Suitable for people who doesn't like to trek and who loves greenery.
